# Prelude PHP

An awesome library for data handling!

Prelude is a library for PHP language that aims to be compatible with [Prelude LS](https://github.com/gkz/prelude-ls) and a port
of Haskell's Prelude module. It contains useful functions for data handling and allows functional programming in a more
expressive way.
